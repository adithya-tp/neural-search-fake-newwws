true[SEP]the new virus has been named sars-cov-2. the disease it causes is called covid-19.
true[SEP]in fast-moving epidemics, far more victims pour into hospitals or die at home than doctors can test; at the same time, the mildly ill or asymptomatic never get tested. those two factors distort the true fatality rate in opposite ways. if you don’t know how many people are infected, you don’t know how deadly a virus is.

true[SEP]a novel coronavirus is a new coronavirus that has not been previously identified. the virus causing coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19), is not the same as the coronaviruses that commonly circulate among humans and cause mild illness, like the common cold.a diagnosis with coronavirus 229e, nl63, oc43, or hku1 is not the same as a covid-19 diagnosis. patients with covid-19 will be evaluated and cared for differently than patients with common coronavirus diagnosis.
true[SEP]health authorities around the world have struggled to contain not only the outbreak but also the misinformation about it quickly spreading around the internet. the world health organization has partnered with tech companies, including google, facebook and twitter, to combat falsehoods and misleading information about the coronavirus.

true[SEP]those numbers could be reduced as more cases are discovered. and it is possible that death rates at the center of the outbreak in china, where hospitals were overwhelmed, will end up higher than elsewhere in the world.pathogens can still be very dangerous even if their fatality rate is low. even though influenza has a case fatality rate below one per 1,000, roughly 200,000 people end up hospitalized with the virus each year in the united states, and about 35,000 people die.

fake[SEP]vitamins c and d are now finally being adopted in the conventional treatment of novel coronavirus, sars-cov-2. vitamin c at extremely high doses acts as an antiviral drug, actually killing viruses. although vitamin d does not appear to have a direct effect on the virus itself, it does strengthen immune function, thus allowing the host body to combat the virus more effectively.
true[SEP]practice good hygiene. wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. cover your mouth and nose with your elbow or a tissue when you cough or sneeze. throw away the used tissue. avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth. avoid sharing dishes, glasses, bedding and other household items if you're sick. clean and disinfect high-touch surfaces daily.

fake[SEP]as dr. yuhong asks, “how could this novel virus be so intelligent as to mutate precisely at selected sites while preserving its binding affinity to the human ace2 receptor? how did the virus change just four amino acids of the s-protein? did the virus know how to use clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (crispr) to make sure this would happen?”
true[SEP]the fight against disinformation is a joint effort involving all european institutions. to help fight disinformation, the eu is working in close cooperation with online platforms. we are encouraging them to promote authoritative sources, demote content that is fact-checked as false or misleading, and take down illegal content or content that could cause physical harm.
true[SEP]a study done by national institute of allergy and infectious diseases' laboratory of virology in the division of intramural research in hamilton, montana helps to answer this question. the researchers used a nebulizer to blow coronaviruses into the air. they found that infectious viruses could remain in the air for up to three hours. the results of the study were published in the new england journal of medicine on march 17, 2020.

true[SEP]while the flu shot won't protect you from developing covid-19, it's still a good idea. most people older than six months can and should get the flu vaccine. doing so reduces the chances of getting seasonal flu. even if the vaccine doesn't prevent you from getting the flu, it can decrease the chance of severe symptoms. but again, the flu vaccine will not protect you against this coronavirus.
true[SEP]no, antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria. the new coronavirus (2019-ncov) is a virus and, therefore, antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment. however, if you are hospitalized for the 2019-ncov, you may receive antibiotics because bacterial co-infection is possible.
true[SEP]the most common symptoms of covid-19 are dry cough, tiredness and fever. some people may develop more severe forms of the disease, such as pneumonia. the best way to confirm if you have  the virus producing covid-19 disease is with a laboratory test.  you cannot confirm it with this breathing exercise, which can even be dangerous.
true[SEP]if you are infected, the use of surgical face masks may reduce the risk of you infecting other people. on the other hand there is no evidence that face masks will effectively prevent you from becoming infected with the virus. in fact, it is possible that the use of face masks may even increase the risk of infection due to a false sense of security and increased contact between hands, mouth and eyes while wearing them. the inappropriate use of masks also may increase the risk of infection.
true[SEP]“we face a doleful future,” said dr. harvey v. fineberg, a former president of the national academy of medicine.he and others foresaw an unhappy population trapped indoors for months, with the most vulnerable possibly quarantined for far longer. they worried that a vaccine would initially elude scientists, that weary citizens would abandon restrictions despite the risks, that the virus would be with us from now on.
fake[SEP]dr. fauci, the director of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases and a leading voice on the coronavirus, had buried her research about how vaccines can damage people’s immune systems. it is those weakened immune systems, that have made people susceptible to illnesses like covid-19.secret plot by global elites like bill gates and dr. anthony fauci to use the coronavirus pandemic to profit and grab political power. wearing the mask literally activates your own virus.

true[SEP]health care workers are our first line of defense against disease, whether coronavirus or otherwise. in order to safely and effectively do their jobs they need to both have proper training and the right protective equipment. this keeps them safe from infection in “peace time” and during a large outbreak like we have now.
true[SEP]the key phrase is "large amounts". the power levels put out by phones simply aren't enough to heat up human tissue. the absolute maximum legal limit for radio energy output of a cell phone is 1/1,000th that of a microwave oven. and modern phones almost never transmit at anywhere near that level. phones use many sophisticated technologies to make sure they're outputting the absolute minimum amount of radio energy at any given moment, simply to conserve battery life.
true[SEP]last week, a medical journal reported that a business traveler from china had infected at least one person in germany with the spreading coronavirus even though she had no symptoms. it was decisive evidence that the virus could transmit undetected and a critical piece of information, one of the key factors u.s. officials weighed when formulating unprecedented quarantines and travel restrictions announced by health officials at the white house.

true[SEP]further research has shown sars-cov-2 may linger in the air for extended periods of time, which is particularly notable for health workers. it's estimated the virus can stay suspended in the air for a period of about 30 minutes. social distancing measures become ever more important here because only those close to infected individuals are expected to be exposed to large quantities of the virus in the air. how long can the coronavirus survive on surfaces?
true[SEP]droplets containing the virus cannot travel as far as airborne infectious particles. therefore, the who recommends maintaining a minimum safe distance between self and others of three feet (1m), whereas the cdc recommends a distance of six feet (2m). the 10-foot distance recommended in the video may not be absolutely necessary, but it also couldn’t hurt.
true[SEP]there is no connection between 5g and covid-19. the coronavirus is a virus that is spread from one person to another through droplets that people sneeze, cough or exhale. 5g is the new generation of mobile network technology that is transmitted over non-ionising radio waves. there is no evidence that 5g is harmful to people’s health. the outbreak of coronavirus in the chinese city of wuhan is unrelated to 5g, and is thought to have originated in a seafood wholesale market.

true[SEP]what has undoubtedly influenced the virus’s spread, however, is the human factor: decisions made by governments and individuals alike. while the weather effects are slight, some countries have successfully controlled the virus.the weather can’t be controlled. but our actions can.
true[SEP]this appeal is not based solely on public health concerns. if adequate vaccines, treatments and tests are not developed and distributed in time, a rolling cycle of lockdowns and distancing measures could ebb and flow for months, if not years, with new outbreaks and economic downturns postponing recovery indefinitely.
true[SEP]we know that the virus can be transmitted when people who are infected show symptoms such as coughing. there is also some evidence suggesting that transmission can occur from a person that is infected even two days before showing symptoms; however, uncertainties remain about the effect of transmission by asymptomatic persons.
fake[SEP]for three months, we’ve been urging our readers to pursue sensible nutritional strategies to boost immune function and protect against infections. now a study carried out by northwestern university has found that higher vitamin d levels result in lower mortality rates from covid-19 infections.vitamin d deficiency, according to the study, was significantly linked to the development of severe symptoms and complications leading to death.

true[SEP]we don't know for certain. based on the most recent research, people may continue to be infected with the virus and be potentially contagious for many days after they are feeling better. but these results need to be verified. until then, even after 10 days of complete resolution of your symptoms, you should still take all precautions if you do need to go out in public, including wearing a mask, minimizing touching surfaces, and keeping at least six feet of distance away from other people.
true[SEP]no. vaccines against pneumonia, such as pneumococcal vaccine and haemophilus influenza type b (hib) vaccine, do not provide protection against the new coronavirus.the virus is so new and different that it needs its own vaccine. researchers are trying to develop a vaccine against 2019-ncov, and who is supporting their efforts.although these vaccines are not effective against 2019-ncov, vaccination against respiratory illnesses is highly recommended to protect your health.

fake[SEP]in the worst-case scenario, if the vaccination strain is more highly contagious and lethal, 2019-ncov could become the worst example of vaccine-derived contagious disease in human history. with an uncharacteristic aysmptomatic prodromal period of 5-7 days, individuals returning from china to other countries must be forthright and cooperative in their now-prescribed 2-week quarantine.
true[SEP]by contrast, one of the most promising treatments under development is one of the oldest: convalescent plasma. the idea is to isolate plasma—the liquid part of blood—and then process it to extract a serum rich with antibodies, proteins that bind to pathogens in our bodies and mark them for destruction.
true[SEP]the report found that in laboratory settings, higher temperatures and higher levels of humidity decreased survival of the covid-19 coronavirus. however, studies looking at viral spread in varying climate conditions in the natural environment had inconsistent results.the researchers concluded that conditions of increased heat and humidity alone may not significantly slow the spread of the covid-19 virus.

fake[SEP]it is argued that all of this is necessary for "peaceful research".
true[SEP]the latest theory, laid out in a recent article by the washington post, has another spin on this: the virus source could have been a researcher infected by a bat, or the sloppy disposal of hazardous materials at a wuhan centre for disease control facility near the wet market linked to many early cases in the outbreak.

true[SEP]“modern medicine is constantly needing to catch up to new emerging viruses,” kirkegaard said.sars-cov-2 is particularly enigmatic. though its behavior is different from that of its cousin sars, there are no obvious differences in the viruses’ spiky protein “keys” that allow them to invade host cells.
fake[SEP]the coronavirus epidemic marks the beginning of an era of crisis for pan-european identity and solidarity. national borders between the eu countries, closed by [state] governments, have become a clear illustration of [the eu’s] inefficiency and its failed health and safety policies. therefore, all the bureaucratic structures of the eu, as well as political forces oriented towards the globalist agenda, feel a clear threat of losing their power.
fake[SEP]it seems quite apparent that unicef and who use these local disasters to mass vaccinate people, mainly children and young women. massive education and propaganda efforts are also necessary to convince the local populations that they need these vaccines.
fake[SEP]thus the virus has ripped apart the open society at the seams and thrust mankind forward on its voyage toward a multipolar world.

true[SEP]no. antibiotics do not work against viruses; they only work on bacterial infections. covid-19 is caused by a virus, so antibiotics do not work. antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment of covid-19. in hospitals physicians will sometimes use antibiotics to prevent or treat secondary bacterial infections which can be a complication of covid-19 in severely ill patients. they should only be used as directed by a physician to treat a bacterial infection.

fake[SEP]the resultant medical monotheism requires absolute obedience to the absurd notion that there is only one way to define and treat the body. this, of course, makes biomedical interventions like vaccination and chemotherapy mandatory and marks the end of all personal choice and liberty.
true[SEP]an antiviral drug must be able to target the specific part of a virus's life cycle that is necessary for it to reproduce. in addition, an antiviral drug must be able to kill a virus without killing the human cell it occupies. and viruses are highly adaptive. because they reproduce so rapidly, they have plenty of opportunity to mutate (change their genetic information) with each new generation, potentially developing resistance to whatever drugs or vaccines we develop.
fake[SEP]most people living today, especially younger people, have no idea that a key agenda of globalism is the elimination of “undesirable” humans from the gene pool. they believe that ideas of “eugenics” and genocide were only carried out by the nazis, not by american university professors and presidential science advisors.
